The Spring to Life Drop brings variety to the overworld by adding new mob variants and some nice ambient features, like fallen
trees and wildflowers.

These additions bring life to the overworld forests, however there are still some features that might be added
which would fit the drop's theme...

So here's this mod, adding more ambient features like hollow logs, new mobs, firefly jars and more! ü¶ã

-------------------------

### üå∏ Features

#### FIREFLY JARS

Fireflies from a Firefly Bush can now be caught using a glass bottle.

<img src="./.docs/firefly_jar.png" alt="Firefly Jar" />

Up to 5 fireflies can be put in a Firefly Jar. The block's light level depends on the amount of fireflies.

A Firefly Bush contains a random amount of fireflies that can be caught before being "empty".

<img src="./.docs/empty_firefly_bush.png" alt="Empty Firefly Bush" />

After a while, fireflies will reappear inside the bush at night.

#### HOLLOW LOGS

When the Wild Update was first introduced, a concept art for the Birch Forest was shown, showcasing some hollow logs.

Now, with this mod, you can find and get these hollow logs for all kind of wood types!

<img src="./.docs/hollow_logs.png" alt="Hollow Logs" />

Fallen trees with hollow logs might generate in forest biomes (like regular fallen trees).

You can hollow a log by shift-right clicking a regular log, which can then also be stripped.

Hollow logs can also be waterlogged

<img src="./.docs/waterlogged_hollow_logs.png" alt="Waterlogged Hollow Logs" />

### MUSHROOMS ON LOGS

Red and Brown mushrooms can now be placed on the Logs sides.

<img src="./.docs/mushrooms_on_logs.png" alt="Mushrooms on Logs" />

Up to 4 mushrooms of the same type can be placed in one block

#### LEAF PILES

When Leaf Litters were announced, everyone thought they would be stackable, like snow layers. Unfortunately that is not the case,
but fear not because Leaf Piles have been added!

<img src="./.docs/leaf_piles.png" alt="Leaf Piles" />

Leaf Piles are crafted using, well, Leaves, like a snow layer

<img src="./.docs/leaf_piles_crafting.png" alt="Leaf Piles Crafting" />

Leaf Piles can also be waterlogged!

<img src="./.docs/waterlogged_leaf_piles.png" alt="Waterlogged Leaf Piles" />

#### SNOWY AND MORE POTTED PLANTS

We got cold and hot variants of mobs. We also got hot variant of grass. But why no cold variant?

Introducing the Snowy Grass, Snowy Tall Grass and Snowy Bush!

<img src="./.docs/snowy_plants.png" alt="Snowy Plants" />

Snowy Plants can be found in Snowy Biomes and can also be placed on Snow and Powder Snow

They can be potted, as well as other plants like Cactus Flower, Bush, Short and Tall Dry Grass

<img src="./.docs/potted_plants.png" alt="Potted Plants" />

Also, Bushes and Snowy Bushes can be smelted into Dead Bushes

### PRICKLY PEARS CACTUS

Cactus will now spawn more frequently in Wooded Badlands nad they can sometimes grow Prickly Pears on top, like they do with Cactus Flowers.

<img src="./.docs/prickly_pears.png" alt="Prickly Pears" />

Prickly Pears can be eaten and will restore a fair amount of hunger

They can be potted

<img src="./.docs/potted_prickly_pear.png" alt="Potted Prickly Pear" />

### ASPHODEL

A new two-blocks tall flower will spawn in Old Growth Birch Forests: the Asphodel

<img src="./.docs/asphodel.png" alt="Asphodel" />

Asphodels will randomly produce some subtle particles around their tips, can be used to breed and tempt bees and can be crafted into white dye

### MOOBLOOM AND BUTTERCUP

You've read that right: Mooblooms are here!

<img src="./.docs/moobloom.png" alt="Moobloom" />

Mooblooms will sometime spawn in Flower Forests and have 4 new flowers on top of them: the Buttercup.

Using a shear on them will drop 4 buttercups, which will then take 5 minutes to regrow.

Using a bowl on them will give a Suspicious Stew with the Absorption effect (same as if crated with a Buttercup).

The Buttercup doesn't generate naturally in any biome, so the only way to get them is to find a Moobloom.

Buttercups can be potted and can be turned into yellow dye

<img src="./.docs/potted_buttercup.png" alt="Potted Buttercup" />

### MUDDY PIGS

Another great feature taken from Minecraft Earth is the Muddy Pig.

<img src="./.docs/muddy_pig.png" alt="Muddy Pig" />

Muddy Pigs spawn in Mangrove Swamps and might have a Poppy on them.

When sheared, the poppy will drop and won't regrow.

Muddy Pigs can also be washed using a Water Bucket, which makes them turn into a Temperate Pig

Baby Muddy Pigs will never have a flower, as well as any Muddy Pig that comes from breeding 

### BUTTERFLIES

A new ambient mob has been added to Forest biomes: the butterfly.

<img src="./.docs/butterflies.png" alt="Butterflies" />

Butterflies are very weak and drops nothing.

Can be tempted using small flowers

### NEW MUSIC DISC: SWEDEN

Sweden by C418 has been added as a new Music Disc.

<img src="./.docs/music_disc_sweden.png" alt="Sweden Music Disc" />

This new Music Disc can be found in a new structure, the campsite, and gives a comparator output of 15

### CAMPSITES

Campsites will sometime generate in Forest, Birch Forest and Taiga biomes.

<img src="./.docs/spruce_campsite.png" alt="Spruce Campsite" />

The chest contains various loot, including the new Music Disc, some Logs, some food and some Stone or Wooden Tools.
